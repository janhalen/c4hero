# Features

A more detailed reference for what c4hero ships. The README is the elevator pitch; this is the full menu.

## C4 modelling

- Visual editing for **people, software systems, containers, and components** — the full C4 element vocabulary.
- Four view types: **system landscape, system context, container, and component**.
- Drill-through navigation between views (zoom into a system → its containers; zoom into a container → its components). View history with back navigation.
- **Boundaries are first-class.** Container and component views auto-render the parent system / container as a labelled boundary around its members.
- **Groups** for ad-hoc clustering across element types.

## Structurizr DSL

- Parses and serializes the [Structurizr DSL](https://docs.structurizr.com/dsl/language) — the same format used by Structurizr Lite, Studio, and the Java/JSON exporters.
- Round-trips: `parse(serialize(workspace)) === workspace` for everything c4hero models. Substantial round-trip test coverage protects this contract.
- Supports element styles, relationship styles, tags (with cascade), `properties { … }` blocks, owners, technology, status, custom URLs, and `!docs` / `!adrs` references.
- Sidecar JSON file (`<workspace>.c4hero.json`) holds non-DSL metadata — node positions, view auto-layout direction, viewport state — so layout survives DSL edits.

## File workflows

- **Folder collections** (Chromium browsers): open a folder of `.dsl` files, pick a workspace, and edit. Saves write back to disk via the File System Access API.
- **Single-file mode** (all browsers): open a `.dsl` file directly. Saves either go back to the source handle (where supported) or trigger a download.
- **Recent collections / files** are remembered in `localStorage` and re-openable from the welcome screen.
- **Crash recovery**: the active workspace is mirrored to `localStorage`. If the tab crashes or you close it mid-edit, the next launch offers to restore.

## Editing UX

- **Inspector** (right panel) for element and relationship properties: name, description, technology, owner (with autocomplete from existing teams), URL, status, tags.
- **Add Element panel** (left): quick-create new elements or pull existing-but-out-of-view elements onto the canvas. Auto-wires relationships from the model on add.
- **Multi-select** mode (M) for batch operations: group, delete, duplicate.
- **Highlighter panel** (H): tag, status, technology, and team filters that stack across facets to highlight matching subgraphs without hiding the rest of the diagram. Each facet has Any-of / All-of mode.
- **Search** (⌘F): jump to any element across views.
- **Command palette** (⌘K): every action is reachable from here, with shortcuts shown alongside.

## Layout

- **Auto-arrange** with dagre, with selectable direction (TB / BT / LR / RL).
- **Snap to 32px grid** so manually-placed nodes land on visible dots.
- **Smart edge routing**: handle slot picker spreads multiple edges across a node's side (a/b/c slots) so they don't overlap.
- **Zoom-to-fit** that respects the floating chrome, so the diagram is centred in the visible canvas, not under the panels.

## Export

- **PNG** and **SVG** export of the current view, with optional padding control.
- **DSL** export (Save As) writes a clean `.dsl` plus its sidecar JSON.
- Exports are deterministic — same workspace, same bytes — so they diff cleanly in pull requests.

## Accessibility

- ARIA labels on every canvas node and panel.
- Focus-trap on every dialog with focus restoration on close.
- Keyboard shortcuts for every common action; full list in the command palette.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured for canvas animations and the loading skeleton.
- Forced-colors mode is supported.

## Privacy

- No telemetry by default. Hosted deployments can opt in to Cloudflare Web Analytics and Sentry error reporting without sending workspace contents.
- Files stay on your device; nothing is uploaded to a c4hero server. There is no c4hero server.
- See [`PRIVACY.md`](../PRIVACY.md) for the full statement.

## Browser support

Folder collections require the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) — currently only available in Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera). On Firefox and Safari, c4hero automatically falls back to single-file mode; everything else (rendering, editing, export) works identically.
